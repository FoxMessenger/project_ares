WAS MOST DIFFICULT
LOGIN 
API out of date
Price of other APIS
Limited usage of freemium APIs

EXTRA FEATURES
User profile
tracking movies given
tracking movies they liked, and tailoring the algorithm to give them movies dependent on what they have liked
Create a Modal instead of popping up on the second half of the screen
make the image clickable, instead of just the button

START OVER
Not spend as much time for the login and probably not use the same framework
Better psuedo code 
Deviate actual tasks better
Not use Flixster API
