                <p class="heavy">The purpose of the Almost Perfect Pick app, <i>dubbed The APP,</i> is to ensure you receive a hassle free movie, of, on which you weren't already deciding. <p>
                <p>Because choosing things can be an awful process, unless it's your parents. That's where our next app comes in. We're making the Two Almost Perfect Parents app (TAPP). It's like Tinder, but to find two new people you can call mom and dad... or mom and mom... or dad and dad... whatever.</p>
                <p> Our APP is directly connected to Netflix, with our code being parced through OMDB to ensure a mid to high rating for our selected movie, with which we pass on to you for your viewing pleasure. </p>
                <p>We used OMDB's rating system, because Netflix's user rating system is trash. </p>
                <p>It's the equivelant of being 6 years old and having to eat your birthday cake after nana fell asleep in it, and Aunti Mei is still running around naked... again... quite unpleasant and clearly not a story Andy was telling with trust.</p>
                <p>We want to ensure the user a most excellent and satisfactory viewing experience.</p>
                <p>Cheers,</p>
                <p>-Team APP</p>
